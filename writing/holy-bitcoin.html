      <h2>Design Concerns in Creating Privacy Notices</h2>

        <p><i>May 29, 2018</i></p>

        <h3>The Role of Design in Enabling Informed Consent</h3>

        <p>The purpose of privacy notices and choice mechanisms is to notify users of the data practices of a system, so they can make informed privacy decisions. Currently, privacy notices and choice mechanisms, are largely ineffective. Privacy and security researchers have concluded that privacy notices not only fail to help consumers make informed privacy decisions but are mostly ignored by them. [1] They have been reduced to being a mere necessity to ensure legal compliance for companies. The design of privacy systems has an essential role in determining whether the users read the notices and understand them. While it is important to assess the data practices of a company, the communication of privacy policies to users is also a key factor in ensuring that the users are protected from privacy threats. If they do not read or understand the privacy policy, they are not protected by it at all.

<p>The visual communication of a privacy notice is determined by the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design of that online platform. User experience design is broadly about creating the logical flow from one step to the next in any digital system, and user interface design ensures that each screen or page that the user interacts with has a consistent visual language and styling. This compliments the path created by the user experience designer. [2] UI/UX design still follows the basic principles of visual communication where information is made understandable, usable and interesting with the use of elements such as colours, typography, scale, and spacing.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate informed consent, the design principles are to be applied to ensure that the privacy policy is presented clearly, and in the most accessible form. A paper by Batya Friedman, Peyina Lin, and Jessica K. Miller, ‘Informed Consent By Design’, presents a model of informed consent for information systems. [3] It mentions the six components of the model; Disclosure, Comprehension, Voluntariness, Competence, Agreement, Minimal Distraction. The design of a notice should achieve these components to enable informed consent. Disclosure and comprehension lead to the user being ‘informed’ while ‘consent’ encompasses voluntariness, competence, and agreement. Finally, The tasks of being informed and giving consentshould happen with minimal distraction, without diverting users from their primary taskor overwhelming them with unnecessary noise.[4]</p>

<p>UI/UX design builds upon user behaviour to anticipate their interaction with the platform. It has led to practices where the UI/UX design is directed at influencing the user to respond in a way that is desired by the system. For instance, the design of default options prompts users to allow the system to collect their data when the ‘Allow’ button is checked by default. Such practices where the interface design is used to push users in a particular direction are called “dark patterns”.[5] These are tricks used in websites and apps that make users buy or sign up for things that they did not intend to. [6] Dark patterns are often followed as UI/UX trends without the consequences on users being questioned. This has had implications on the design of privacy systems as well. Privacy notices are currently being designed to be invisible instead of drawing attention towards them.</p>

<p>Moreover, most communication designers believe that privacy notices are beyond their scope of expertise. They do not consider themselves accountable for how a notice comes across to the user. Designers also believe that they have limited agency when it comes to designing privacy notices as most of the decisions have been already taken by the company or the service. They can play a major role in communicating privacy concerns at an interface level, but the issues of privacy are much deeper. Designers tend to find ways of informing the user without compromising the user experience, and in the process choose aesthetic decisions over informed consent.</p>

        <h3>Issues with Visual Communication of Privacy Notices</h3>

        <p>The ineffectiveness of privacy notices can be attributed to several broad issues such as the complex language and length, their timing, and location. In 2015, the Center for Plain Language [7] published a privacy-policy analysis report [8] for TIME.com [9], evaluating internet-based companies’ privacy policies to determine how well they followed plain language guidelines. The report concluded that among the most popular companies, Google and Facebook had the more accessible notices, while Apple, Uber, and Twitter were ranked as less accessible. The timing of notices is also crucial in ensuring that it is read by the users. The primary task for the user is to avail the service being offered. The goals of security and privacy are valued but are only secondary in this process. [10] Notices are presented at a time when they are seen as a barrier between the user and the service. People thus, choose to ignore the notices and move on to their primary task. Another concern is disassociated notices or notices which are presented on a separate website or manual. The added effort of going to an external website also gets in the way of the users which leads to them not reading the notice. While most of these issues can be dealt with at the strategic level of designing the notice, there are also specific visual communication design issues that are required to be addressed.</p>

        <p><b>Invisible Structure and Organisation of Information</b></p>
        <p>Long spells of text with no visible structure or content organisation is the lowest form of privacy notices. These are the blocks of text where the information is flattened with no visual markers such as a section separator, or contrasting colour and typography to distinguish between the types of content. In such notices, the headings and subheadings are also not easy to locate and comprehend. For a user, the large block of text appears to be pointless and irrelevant, and they begin to dismiss or ignore it. Further, the amount of time it would take for the user to read the entire text and comprehend it successfully, is simply impractical, considering the number of websites they visit regularly.</p>

        <p>Robert Netzly, the CEO of Inspire Investing (which provides <a href="https://www.inspireinvesting.com/2018/01/12/should-christians-invest-in-bitcoin/">"low cost, biblically responsible investments"</a>), quotes Proverbs 13:11 and recommends staying off the Bitcoin mania because it's driven by "greed", "plain and simple".</p>

        <p>Joe Carter, of the Acton Institute and the Gospel Coalition, is also of the opinion that Bitcoin is a bubble. However, he is not so quick to discard its technological importance. He <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/53396-what-christians-should-know-about-bitcoin-part-3-of-3.html">notes</a>, "[i]f the experiment is unlikely to succeed, then why should anyone bother paying attention to Bitcoin? The reason can be found in another, more successful, completely pernicious, online venture: porn."  Since the "Internet was completely funded by porn", and porn "has been a driver of innovation in many areas of information technology", he concludes, "[t]he question we Christians must ask is whether it is wise stewardship to fund the growth of a system in which thousands of people will eventually lose real, significant wealth in the hope that it might lead to [...] innovations [in peer-to-peer trust systems]."  Philip Booth, professor of finance, public policy and ethics at St Mary’s University, <a href="http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/issues/may-25th-2018/why-catholics-should-take-cryptocurrencies-seriously/">expresses</a> a similar view in the <i>Catholic Herald</i>.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the strongest criticism comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilarion_(Alfeyev)">Bishop Hilarion</a>, an influential clergyman in the Orthodox Church of Russia. (Personally, he has "not yet been asked to bless anyone’s mining operation.") He feels that "cryptocurrency is a new financial bubble, a new Ponzi scheme, behind which there is nothing." He also <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/414650-cryptocurrency-dollar-orthodox-church/">said</a> the same thing about US dollars.</p>

        <p>Some other churches don't seem to mind Bitcoin at all. SpendBitcoins.com <a href="http://spendbitcoins.com/places/c/churches/serving/All">lists</a> four churches that accept Bitcoins as donations. I was able to find <a href="https://www.shorelineuu.org/ways-to-share.html">a. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/church-zurich-accepts-donations-bitcoin-bch-ether-ripple-stellar/">few.</a> <a href="https://www.ccn.com/kentucky-church-now-accepting-bitcoin/">more</a>. And if you're still not sure whether it's Christian-like to invest in Bitcoin, may I recommend <a href="https://christcoins.io/">Christ Coin</a>?</p>

        <h3>Islam</h3>

        <p>Since Islam has its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_banking_and_finance">systems of banking and finance</a>, I was not surprised to find some serious academic literature on whether cryptocurrencies are shari'ah-compliant.</p>

        <p>A good starting point is <a href="http://bmeb-bi.org/index.php/BEMP/article/view/902/699"><i>Cryptocurrencies from Islamic Perspecties: The Case of Bitcoin</i></a>. He notes that all currency which has no intrinsic value is, strictly speaking, not shari'ah-compliant. Normally, fiat national currencies are allowed through "maslahah" jurisprudence (which adjudicates prohibition/permission on the basis of societal value, usually invoked in cases not regulated by the Qur'an or the teachings of Prophet Muhammad). Meera concludes that, "strictly speaking, cryptocurrencies that are not backed with real assets are not shari’ah-compliant", but "gold-backed cryptocurrencies" are consistent with shari'ah.</p>

        <p>Mufti Faraz Adam, a Shari'ah Consultant at Amanah Finance Consultancy Ltd., takes Bitcoin through three Islamic criteria for money:</p>
        <p>
          1. <i>Mal</i> (Wealth): "what is normally desired and can be stored up for the time of need"<br>
          2. <i>Taqawwum</i> (Legality): asset must be lawful<br>
          3. <i>Thamaniyyah</i>: "potential of something to be a measure of value and be commonly used as a medium of exchange"
        </p>

        <p>In his <a href="http://www.iefpedia.com/english/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bitcoin-Shariah-Compliant-Mufti-Faraz-Adam.pdf">long paper</a>, he concludes that Bitcoin passes the <i>Mal</i> and <i>Taqawwum</i> tests, but fails the <i>Thamaniyyah</i> test because it has "security risk, technological risk, money laundering risk, volatility risk, data risk, transaction risk, intermediary risk, regulatory challenge, structural deflation risk, competition, scalability risk, monopoly risk, liquidity risk." (If you are Satoshi Nakomoto, please <a href="https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/thermal-heat-or-fire-burns-treatment#1">visit this page</a>.)</p>

        <p>Shawki Allam, Grand Mufti of Egypt, seems to agree with the "risk" argument since he <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/egypts-religion-leader-crypto-trading-forbidden-by-islamic-law/">issued</a> a fatwa in January 2018 declaring cryptocurrency trading as forbidden under Islamic law on similar grounds. The Turkish Ministry Presidency of Religious Affairs, in 2017, <a href="">declared</a> all cryptocurrency trade un-Islamic because they don't have government backing. Two imams in Turkey have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/two-turkish-imams-fired-allegedly-investing-bitcoin/">fired</a> because they allegedly invested in Bitcoin. A Saudi cleric has also <a href="https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2017/12/235779/assim-al-hakeem-digital-currency-bitcoin-haram-islam-cryptocurrencies/">declared</a> Bitcoins as haram.</p>

        <p>In India, Maulana Wali Rahmani, general secretary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, issued a statement declaring Bitcoins as un-Islamic. Running off the Saudi cleric's reasoning, he <a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/bitcoins-are-not-islamic-a-new-directive-tells-indian-muslims/81190/">raises six objections</a>:</p>

        <p>"1. No government or banking control over bitcoin<br>
        2. No physical presence of coin or cryptocurrency<br>
        3. Highly volatile, no link between cryptocurrency and physical assets such as gold, silver, metals.<br>
        4. No protection against theft, hacking etc.<br>
        5. Strong possibility of its use in buying drugs, money laundering, terrorism, anti-social activities<br>
        6. No legal avenues such as moving courts and institutions to redress grievances"<br></p>

        <p>(Bonus 1: In his paper, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1028.1609&rep=rep1&type=pdf"><i>Bitcoin and Islamic Finance</i></a>, Jan Bergsta notes that Bitcoin mining may be problematic in Islam due to its probabalistic returns.)</p>

        <p>(Bonus 2: If you're Muslim and invested in Bitcoin, don't worry: Mufti Adam's aforementioned paper says, "[n]evertheless, any return on Bitcoin investments would be lawful and shari'ah compliant.")</p>

        <p>(Bonus 3: There is a whole project called <a href="https://www.islamandbitcoin.com/">Islam and Bitcoin</a>, with a blog and a podcast!)</p>

        <h3>Judaism</h3>

        <p>Rabbi Yehuda Shurpin, of the Chabad, <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3393162/sc/fb/jewish/Does-Judaism-Consider-Bitcoins-to-Be-Money.htm">makes it clear</a> that Bitcoin is not currency according to the Torah. However, it may be treated as a commodity. (Who knew 21st century lawyers get their arguments from Hasidism?) Since the laws of usury apply to commodities as well, "[p]ractically, that means that if you borrow bitcoins from someone, you need to return the value of the bitcoins you borrowed, not actual bitcoins."</p>

        <p>Vyacheslav Semenchuk, on the other hand, may not have given this too much thought since he launched <a href="https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/bitcoen/">Bitcoen</a>, "the first Kosher cryptocurrency."</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Contemporary religious views on cryptocurrencies are nuanced (especially in Islamic scholarship), but none have come out strongly in favour of it. Additionally, most commentary seems to be on Bitcoin, rather than cryptocurrencies in general. In the future, each cryptocurrency may merit its own religious analysis.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, none of this matters. As <i>Becoming Christians</i> <a href="https://becomingchristians.com/2017/12/18/how-bitcoin-is-fulfilling-bible-prophecy/">notes</a>, "You see, at the end, it is really not Bitcoin that we should be worrying about. It is our relationship with God."</p>
